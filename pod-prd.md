# POD (Proof of Degree) - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Document Information
- **Document Title**: POD (Proof of Degree) PRD
- **Version**: 1.0
- **Status**: Draft
- **Last Updated**: [Current Date]
- **Document Owner**: [Your Name/Organization]

## 2. Executive Summary
POD (Proof of Degree) is a blockchain-based proof of concept that establishes a trustless system for academic credential verification. The platform allows universities to register, receive validation from an admin, and issue verifiable diplomas to graduates. Students can then mint these diplomas as non-transferable tokens, creating an immutable record of their academic achievements. This solution addresses credential fraud issues while maintaining data privacy and providing a transparent verification mechanism.

## 3. Problem Statement
Traditional academic credential verification is often:
- Time-consuming and manual
- Vulnerable to fraud and forgery
- Difficult to verify internationally
- Dependent on the continued existence of the issuing institution

A blockchain-based solution offers immutable records, global accessibility, and trustless verification.

## 4. Target Users & Stakeholders

### 4.1 Primary Users
- **Admin**: Smart contract deployer with approval authority
- **Universities**: Educational institutions issuing diplomas
- **Students**: Graduates who mint their diploma tokens
- **Verifiers**: Employers, other institutions, or individuals verifying credentials

### 4.2 Stakeholders
- **Educational Regulatory Bodies**: Organizations that may require compliance with educational standards
- **Developers**: Technical team building the solution
- **Blockchain Network**: Infrastructure providers

## 5. Product Objectives
- Create a trustless, transparent system for academic credential verification
- Demonstrate blockchain utility for academic verification use cases
- Establish a proof of concept for a more comprehensive credential management system
- Provide a simple, secure platform for diploma issuance and verification
- Reduce administrative overhead in credential verification

## 6. User Stories

### 6.1 Admin
- As an admin, I want to deploy the smart contract to establish the platform governance
- As an admin, I want to review university registration requests to ensure legitimacy
- As an admin, I want to approve or reject university registrations to maintain platform integrity

### 6.2 Universities
- As a university, I want to register on the platform to begin issuing digital credentials
- As a university, I want to generate diplomas for multiple graduates efficiently
- As a university, I want to maintain control over which graduates receive credentials

### 6.3 Students
- As a student, I want to mint my diploma token to claim my verifiable credential
- As a student, I want to prove the authenticity of my diploma to potential employers
- As a student, I want assurance that my personal information remains private

### 6.4 Verifiers
- As a verifier, I want to check the authenticity of a diploma quickly and reliably
- As a verifier, I want to confirm which university issued a particular diploma

## 7. Core Features & Functionality

- One-time minting process per diploma
- Soulbound token implementation (non-transferable)

### 7.4 Verification System
- Public verification of diploma authenticity
- Transparency of issuing university
- Tamper-proof credential records
- Time-stamped issuance information

## 8. Technical Requirements

### 8.1 Technology Stack
